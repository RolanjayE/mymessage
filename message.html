I realize it might sound a bit awkward, but I felt it was time to let you know. Now hahahhaha, I'm pleased that I've mustered the courage to send you this message, even though I may not have a chance, hahahaha. I'm aware that you might have someone special in your life, and I just want to convey my sincere wishes for good luck on your journey</p>
